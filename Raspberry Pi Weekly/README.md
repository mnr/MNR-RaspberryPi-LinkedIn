Raspberry Pi lets you explore electronics, computer, programming, and the Internet of Things. You can build complex projects on a budgetâ€”from robots to media servers. This weekly series helps you create meaningful projects in a short time, and learn tips and key techniques that will help you across your creations. Each episode teaches you a coherent set of software and hardware approaches to connect computing power to the physical world. Join instructor Mark Niemann-Ross every week for a new Raspberry Pi technique.
